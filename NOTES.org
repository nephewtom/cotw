I'm wondering how I could make a 3D object glow with an outline when I hover the mouse over it (highlighting) with Raylib. What are some concepts I'd need to be familiar with? Does anyone have any good resources they'd recommend? Thanks 
JeffM ‚Äî 5:10 PM
you'd do that in a shader
look up sobel edge detection
or draw it to a render texture, then put the glow on the render texture with a shader after you draw it.
Nahua ‚Äî 5:16 PM
Is this approach similar to the post-processing example? And thank you for the hints! 
JeffM ‚Äî 5:18 PM
yes

you can patch out just the ones you need for updates
nephewtom ‚Äî 5:51 PM
I was going to ask about this...
I played around postprocessing examples, but those render the complete scene.
In the case for effects as glow or similar in a specific object... 
JeffM ‚Äî 5:51 PM
you'd have to render the object to it's own little render texture
then glow that
then draw that render texturure to the scene
a glow shader is somewhat complex
nephewtom ‚Äî 5:52 PM
well @Bigfoot71 has it implemented in r3d...
JeffM ‚Äî 5:52 PM
then you should totally go see what they did
and just do that
nephewtom ‚Äî 5:53 PM
sorry, i am a bit slow on this...
JeffM ‚Äî 5:53 PM
there are many ways to do it
if they have a solution you like just pull that out and into your code
nephewtom ‚Äî 5:55 PM
yeah, i have tried to learn shaders several times, and found it a bit hard... 
you have to change the traditional way of looking at things.
JeffM ‚Äî 5:56 PM
there is always a shader involved
if you mean '1995' as traditional, then yes
nephewtom ‚Äî 5:56 PM
yep, i am old... üòÇ
JeffM ‚Äî 5:56 PM
yeah, you are not doing pixel operations
the GPU can only draw geometry
and the vertex and fragment shaders are always a part of the pipeline
you can't really 'plot a pixel'
you can draw geometry that covers a screen space fragment, and then use a shader to determine what color those fragments are
nephewtom ‚Äî 5:58 PM
i learnt graphics programming rendering pixels in assembler in an AmstradCPC...
that old...
JeffM ‚Äî 5:58 PM
yeah, that's not useful
you have to think of the GPU as another computer
and you program it how to draw
your game provides the input
and the GPU program turns that into pixels
nephewtom ‚Äî 6:00 PM
if i understand it, the key is that the shader only applies to the specific object...
JeffM ‚Äî 6:00 PM
depends what shader you are talking about
a shader program is made of 2 shaders, vertex and fragment
there is always one shader program active at a time
nephewtom ‚Äî 6:00 PM
yep, i know that
JeffM ‚Äî 6:01 PM
all draw calls (triangles) are processed through the current shader program
so when you draw geometry, first it's vertex data is processed by the vertex shader and turned into screen space verts
then the GPU driver will rasterize those screen space triangles into fragments (pixels).
then for each fragment, it is processed by the current fragment shader to get the color of that pixel
then that pixel is blended to the current render target
nephewtom ‚Äî 6:02 PM
yes, all that theory i know
let me think an very easy example so i can expose my doubts
JeffM ‚Äî 6:02 PM
trying to 'draw' in the fragment shader is like trying to draw the mona-lisa with just a function like this.

Color GetPixelColor(int x, int y);
the fragment shaders' job is to just compute a color
so for many effects you have to think about it backwards.
you can't just think about the output you want, you need to figure out how to get that output from the little input you have
so the tough bit for an outline shader is, if you want to set pixel data that is outside of the geometry you send, the fragment shader will never be called for those pixels. You then have to come up with some way to get a shader called for those pixels, and that's why post processing is common, you can simply draw a quad over the entire area with the input pixels as a texture, then the fragment shader becomes much closer to a 'pixel fliter' kind of operation
but that means you need to have the source pixels generated before the shader runs, thus the render texture
JeffM ‚Äî 6:13 PM
if your objects are convex, there is the cheap and easy way to get an outline :), scale the mesh by a small bit and reverse it's culling, then draw it in in a solid color
nephewtom ‚Äî 6:14 PM
aha... honestly i am a bit overwhelmed now...
JeffM ‚Äî 6:14 PM
yeah, it's a big thing to get used to
took me ages, and I only just now scratch the surface
it helps to understand the graphics pipeline
nephewtom ‚Äî 6:15 PM
yep, i know that feeling...
The example would be as simple as having a camera looking at a sphere and a cube.
The cube has no effect but the sphere has a glow effect or an outline shader... 
(may be i am too noob and a glow and a different outline shader can not be group together...)

The camera can move so sometimes one is behind the other an viceversa.
I can do it using r3d, but i have that feeling that i do not know what i am really doing...

I will put it as a personal exercise, because the only way to learn this stuff is to try and keep trying.
If i don't get it, i will come back here for help.
JeffM ‚Äî 6:18 PM
in the end, the shaders themseves do very simple things, transform a vert, select a color.  It's us that has to figure out how to do the magic using those simple API.s
nephewtom ‚Äî 6:19 PM
it is something i will need for a small game i am crafting, but at this point i am working in the gameplay part
JeffM ‚Äî 6:19 PM
r3d is more like a full rendering engine with a scenegraph and a complex lighting setup
I would see how they handle the outline
if it's done as part of the shader for the sphere, or done as a post processes
I don't recall if r3d is doing differed rendering or not, bcause that is it's own entirely different thing
