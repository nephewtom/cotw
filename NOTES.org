* Special quote
#+begin_example
“We know that they are lying, they know that they are lying, they even know that we know they are lying, we also know that they know we know they are lying too, they of course know that we certainly know they know we know they are lying too as well, but they are still lying. In our country, the lie has become not just moral category, but the pillar industry of this country.”
― Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn


“Sabemos que nos mienten
Ellos saben que mienten
Ellos saben que sabemos que nos mienten
Sabemos que ellos saben que sabemos que nos mienten
Y sin embargo, siguen mintiendo”

- Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn
