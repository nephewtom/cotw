* Introduction
face

This file describes some mechanisms needed to store the state of the cube for the game Cube of The Words (COTW).
It describes the mechanisms and data necessary to save the cube orientation and be able to use it for the gameplay.

If you are using Emacs, this will enhance this buffer with some colors.

* Rotations table
The rotations table is a table that describes the rotation state of the cube before applying a new rotation, and the final result of applying the new rotation, so the stored rotations can be simplified, because there are many equivalent rotations that leave the cube with the same orientation.

The convention that has been followed is to consider four type or rotations:
- positive on X axis: +x
- negative on X axis: -x
- positive on Z axis: +z
- negative on Z axis: -z

It is assumed that the starting position begins with no rotation applied to the cube.
So the initial state is of no-rotation, also expressed as i in the table.

** Explanation of terms used in the table
The /title row/ shows the possible values for the next rotation: __ +x, -x, +z or -z __
=rotation +x= means rotation on the X axis following the right hand rule.
So Y x Z = +x, and in the same manner Z x Y = -x
(Y x Z is the cross-product of the vectors).

The /first column/, indicates the current state of rotations of the cube, before applying the next rotation.

The intersection of the first row and first column, gives us the resulting rotation state.
Have a look at the following table for better understanding.
For example, if state is +x and the next rotation is -z the resulting rotation state is +x-z.

A resulting value of i, denotes that the resulting state is of no-rotation from the initial position.

Manual analysis and a C program have been used to be generate this table.

And soon it was clear a program was needed to make it easier.

*** DONE Program to generate that table
**** DONE First iteration:
Start COMBINING +x,-x,+z,-z with +x,-x,+z,-z; and if +x-x, -x+x, +z-z or -z+z is found, set to i.
This iteration will give a result combination with a size of 2 rotation each.
Iteration result table:
| state    | +x       | -x       | +z       | -z       |
+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+
| i        | +x       | -x       | +z       | -z       |
| +x       | +x+x     | i        | +x+z     | +x-z     |
| -x       | i        | -x-x     | -x+z     | -x-z     |
| +z       | +z+x     | +z-x     | +z+z     | i        |
| -z       | -z+x     | -z-x     | i        | -z-z     |

Total: 1 + 4 rows

+x+x is equivalent to -x-x and +z+z is equivalent to -z-z.
So, -x-x and -z-z won't be included as initial states.

**** DONE Second iteration:
Taking the results from the first iteration, DISCARD the i entries.
Then COMBINE them again with +x,-x,+z,-z.

Now, SIMPLIFY the resulting combination:

+ Trimming: if +x-x, -x+x, +z-z or -z+z are found in any item, then TRIM that part from each result.

+ Equivalences: one rotation is equivalent to other, if it leaves the cube in the same faces orientation.

   - For example, +x+x+x is equivalent to -x, and -x-x-x is equivalent to +x.
     The equivalences of this type will be SIMPLIFIED, and discarded on next iteration.
     #+begin_example
       +x+x+x = -x
       -x-x-x = +x
       +z+z+z = -z
       -z-z-z = +z
     #+end_example
          
   - Also, +x+x+z is equivalent to -x-x+z and there are others with similar pattern.
     The equivalences of this type will be MARKED with D at the end, and discarded on next iteration.
     #+begin_example
       +x+x+z = -x-x+z
       +x+x-z = -x-x-z
       +z+z+x = -z-z+x
       +z+z-x = -z-z-x
     #+end_example
     
   - +x+z+x is equivalent to -x-z-x and +x-z+x is equivalent to -x+z-x and others with similar patterns.
     The equivalences of this type will be MARKED with D at the end, and discarded on next iteration.
     #+begin_example
       +x+z+x = -x-z-x
       +x+z-x = -x-z+x
       +x+z+z = +x-z-z
       +x-z+x = -x+z-x
       +x-z-x = -x+z+x
       -x+z+z = -x-z-z
       +z+x+x = +z-x-x
       +z+x+z = -z-x-z
       +z+x-z = -z-x+z
       +z-x+z = -z+x-z
       +z-x-z = -z+x+z
       -z+x+x = -z-x-x
     #+end_example
     
This iteration will give a result combination with a max size of 3 rotations each, some results with only 1 rotation and some duplicatd entries.

| -z-x     | -z       | -z+x+xD  | +z+x-zD  | +z+x+zD  |

Total: 10 rows

**** DONE Third iteration
Take the result from the second iteration and DISCARD the entries that have less than 3 rotations.
Those will be the ones that have a size less than 6 chars, which have already been combined.
For example, in this case, it will discard, +x in first 12-chunk, -x in the second 12-chunk, etc...
Also, the duplicates won't be included.

Then again, COMBINE the resulting entries with +x,-x,+z,-z
This iteration will give a result combination with a max size of 4 rotations each.

**** DONE Fourth iteration
Now, only 1 state appears:
| +x+x+z+z   | +x+x+z+z+x | +x+x+z+z-x | +x+x+z+z+z | +x+x+z+z-z |

Equivalences:
+x+x+z+z+x = +x+z+z
+x+x+z+z-x = -x+z+z
+x+x+z+z+z = +z+x+x
+x+x+z+z-z = +x+x+z


* Faces tables
It is necessary to know the orientation of the faces of the cube to apply textures in the right way.
So first it is needed to follow a convention to later store it in the source code.

** Faces convention
The faces of the cube in the starting position, with respect to the x and z axes, are named as follows:
#+begin_example
T = TOP (face 1), F = FRONT (face 2), R = RIGHT (face 3) 
K = BACK (face 4), L = LEFT (face 5), M = BOTTOM (face 6) 

z <-----------------------------------+
         +---+             +---+      | 
         | K |             | 4 |      | 
     +---+---+---+     +---+---+---+  | 
     | L | T | R |     | 5 | 1 | 3 |  | 
     +---+---+---+     +---+---+---+  | 
         | F |             | 2 |      | 
         +---+             +---+      | 
         | M |             | 6 |      | 
         +---+             +---+      | 
                                      |
                                      V
                                      x

#+end_example

And this is the convention for the faces orientation with respect to x & z axis:
#+begin_example
U = up, R - right, D = down, L = left

ORIENTED_UP      ORIENTED_RIGHT     ORIENTED_DOWN      ORIENTED_LEFT
z <--------+     z <--------+       z <--------+       z <--------+
     |  ^  |          |     |            |     |            |     |
     |  |  |          | --> |            |  |  |            | <-- |
     |     |          |     |            |  V  |            |     |
     +-----+          +-----+            +-----+            +-----+
           |                |                  |                  |
           V                V                  V                  V
           x                x                  x                  x
#+end_example

** Touching Ground table
For the COTW game prototype, the first approach is to know which face is touching the ground.
That is because it is the one that is going to pick up or release the words from the floor.
We can name that face, the "Touching Ground" face, or *TG face*.

At the starting point, the BOTTOM face (M) is the one touching the ground, but after some rotations that can not be the case, so we need to keep track of which face is touching the ground.

Two fields are used to indicate which face is touching the ground, the face number and the face orientation.
So, at the starting position, the face touching the ground is number 6, oriented down, or 6D.

** Looking Sky table
We can also store the face number and orientation for the face that is opposite to the ground.
This is more clear visually, but let's see how useful/clear it is in practice to use the ground table.

We can name the face that is opposite to the ground as the "Looking Sky" face or *LS face*.
So, 6D for the TG face is equivalent to 1U for the LS face.

It is easy to build the LS table from the TG table.
Just doing these series of substitutions:

| Face 1   | Face 2   | Face 3   | Face 4   | Face 5   | Face 6   |
|----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------|
| 1U -> 6D | 2U -> 4U | 3U -> 5U | 4U -> 2U | 5U -> 3U | 6U -> 1D |
| 1D -> 6U | 2D -> 4D | 3D -> 5D | 4D -> 2D | 5D -> 3D | 6D -> 1U |
| 1R -> 6L | 2R -> 4R | 3R -> 5R | 4R -> 2R | 5R -> 3R | 6R -> 1L |
| 1L -> 6R | 2L -> 4L | 3L -> 5L | 4L -> 2L | 5L -> 3L | 6L -> 1R |
